        It‚Äôs relatively simple to harvest an aloe plant for gel and juice.
        You‚Äôll need a mature plant that‚Äôs at least a few years old. This ensures
        a higher concentration of the active ingredients.
        <br />
        You‚Äôll also want to wait a few weeks before cutting leaves from the same
        plant. You may want to have a few plants on rotation if you plan to
        harvest aloe often.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong> To harvest your aloe plant for gel and juice:</strong>
      </p>
      <hr />
      <ol>
        <li>
          Remove 3-4 leaves at a time, choosing thick leaves from the outer
          sections of the plant.
        </li>
        <li>Ensure the leaves are healthy and free of any mold or damage.</li>
        <li>
          Cut them close to the stem. Most of the beneficial nutrients are found
          at the base of the leaves.
        </li>
        <li>Avoid the roots.</li>
        <li>Wash and dry the leaves.</li>
        <li>Trim the prickly edges with a knife.</li>
        <li>
          Using a knife or your fingers, separate the interior gel from the
          outside of the leaf. The interior gel is the part of the aloe that
          you‚Äôll use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow the yellow sap to drain from the leaf. This is the aloe vera
          latex. If you plan to use the latex, you can catch this in a
          container. If you‚Äôre not planning to use the latex, you can dispose of
          it.
        </li>
        <li>Cut the aloe gel into slices or cubes.</li>
      </ol>
      <hr />
      <p>
        If you want smooth aloe gel, after separating the aloe from the exterior
        part of the leaf, you can put the aloe into a blender and then strain
        the substance to remove the pulp.
