          Aloe vera is a medicinal plant thatâ€™s been used to treat various health
          conditions for thousands of years. Itâ€™s usually safe to use also vera
          directly from the plant or you can buy it in gel form.

          Aloe vera creams, gels, and ointments contain the clear gel found in
          aloe veraleaves. These products can be applied topically to treat
          various skin conditions.
          <br />
          Aloe is sold in capsule or liquid form to take internally to promote
          health and well-being.

          Itâ€™s relatively simple to harvest an aloe plant for gel and juice.
          Youâ€™ll need a mature plant thatâ€™s at least a few years old. This ensures
          a higher concentration of the active ingredients.
          <br />
          Youâ€™ll also want to wait a few weeks before cutting leaves from the same
          plant. You may want to have a few plants on rotation if you plan to
          harvest aloe often.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong> To harvest your aloe plant for gel and juice:</strong>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <ol>
          <li>
            Remove 3-4 leaves at a time, choosing thick leaves from the outer
            sections of the plant.
          </li>
          <li>Ensure the leaves are healthy and free of any mold or damage.</li>
          <li>
            Cut them close to the stem. Most of the beneficial nutrients are found
            at the base of the leaves.
          </li>
          <li>Avoid the roots.</li>
          <li>Wash and dry the leaves.</li>
          <li>Trim the prickly edges with a knife.</li>
          <li>
            Using a knife or your fingers, separate the interior gel from the
            outside of the leaf. The interior gel is the part of the aloe that
            youâ€™ll use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow the yellow sap to drain from the leaf. This is the aloe vera
            latex. If you plan to use the latex, you can catch this in a
            container. If youâ€™re not planning to use the latex, you can dispose of
            it.
          </li>
          <li>Cut the aloe gel into slices or cubes.</li>
        </ol>
        <hr />
        <p>
          If you want smooth aloe gel, after separating the aloe from the exterior
          part of the leaf, you can put the aloe into a blender and then strain
          the substance to remove the pulp.
